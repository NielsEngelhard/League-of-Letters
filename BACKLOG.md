MUST
- multiple languages
- Scan the guess. If it is not in the list with official words, try to check if it is weird like xxxaa. Maybe some sort of latin vibe validator?
- JWT refresh flow
- Automatic cleanup (cronjob?) for guest accounts and "old games"
- statistics regarding games played
- Landing page with explanation





SHOULD
- bring your own word mode
- Support multiple languages English, French and Deutsch at first
- Score explanation
- Sound effects

COULD
- Timer also determines the score (bonus system extended)
- See which player guessed which word
- Online game mode "challenge each other by picking your own words at the beginning of the game"
